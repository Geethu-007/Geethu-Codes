            Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and the phenomena that occur in the cosmos.<br> It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and their overall evolution.Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, meteoroids, asteroids, and comets.<br> Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.<br>

Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky.<br> These include the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars.<br>

Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects.<br> This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena.<br> These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.<br>

Astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events.<br> Amateur astronomers have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.Etymology Astronomical Observatory, New South Wales, Australia 1873

19th-century Quito Astronomical Observatory is located 12 minutes south of the Equator in Quito, Ecuador.<br>
Astronomy means "law of the stars" (or "culture of the stars" depending on the translation). Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects.<br> Although the two fields share a common origin, they are now entirely distinct.

Use of terms "astronomy" and "astrophysics" "Astronomy" and "astrophysics" are synonyms.<br> Based on strict dictionary definitions, "astronomy" refers to "the study of objects and matter outside the Earth's atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties," while "astrophysics" refers to the branch of astronomy dealing with "the behavior, physical properties, and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena".<br> In some cases, as in the introduction of the introductory textbook The Physical Universe by Frank Shu, "astronomy" may be used to describe the qualitative study of the subject, whereas "astrophysics" is used to describe the physics-oriented version of the subject.<br> However, since most modern astronomical research deals with subjects related to physics, modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics.<br> Some fields, such as astrometry, are purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics. Various departments in which scientists carry out research on this subject may use "astronomy" and "astrophysics", partly depending on whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department, and many professional astronomers have physics rather than astronomy degrees.<br> Some titles of the leading scientific journals in this field include The Astronomical Journal, The Astrophysical Journal, and Astronomy & Astrophysics.
